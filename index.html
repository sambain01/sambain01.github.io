                <p>A custom radar module PCB was developed, based on a Texas Instruments 77GHz industrial radar sensor IC, containing a DSP, MCU and hardware accelerator. The modules can detect and locate small obstacles such as low voltage power lines at distances of up to 30 meters with a reliability of 95% within this range, while also detecting other aircraft at a range of up to 200 meters. Each module can simultaneously track the position of up to 30 obstacles in 3d space and report this data back to the primary flight controller over CANBUS using CAN-FD protocols.

                <p>Myself and a fellow coworker worked together to design the printed circuit board to be used for the project.

                <p>Upon validation of the new software, I then began full integration flight testing, in order to quantify the detection rate of the new sensors. Once I had formed an accurate model of the sensors capabilities, I adapted the drones avoidance algorithms in order to optimize them for safety and reliability.

                <p>My parents live on a farm in a remote area, and like to keep track of rainfall and temperature, in order to optimise their pasture management and fertiliser application.</p>
                <p>Traditionally they were using a manual rain gauge and logging the data on a handwritten spreadsheet. This required daily attention in order to get accurate data, and extracting anything meaningful from the data was difficult and time consuming.</p>

            <section class="popup-section">
                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>To design a wireless weather station, capable of measuring and reporting rainfall and temperature every hour of the day. The weather station should require no external power or battery changes, and should be able to report the data to a database stored in the cloud for displaying on a custom webapp.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="popup-section">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>A custom weather station was developed utilising a tip bucket rain gauge design, paired with an esp32 module. The design utilises the onboard hall effect sensor for bucket tip detection, along with the onboard wifi module for reporting the data to a firebase database.</p>
                <p>The design utilises an extremely small 150mW solar panel, which integrates cleanly with the design. In order to sustain its battery level with such low input power, the module utilises esp32's low power subprocessor for registering bucket tips, while waking up once per hour to upload to the database. During periods of extended lack of sunlight when the battery level becomes depleted, the module stores the data in flash until the battery level restabilises, and the data is bulk uploaded to the database. In this mode, the weather station can last 200 days off a single 18650 battery.</p>
